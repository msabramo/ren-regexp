A copy of Michael Forman's awesome "ren-regexp" mass rename utility, since his
web site seems to have disappeared and finding recent versions of the program
seems difficult now

ren-regexp applies one or more regular expressions to a list of file names.
This provides a method of applying common modifications to many files that
would otherwise require repetitive, atomic file operations.
